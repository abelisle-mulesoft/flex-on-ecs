# Running Flex Gateway on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate
This repository contains documentation and resources for successfully deploying and running Anypoint Flex Gateway on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate.
- In the current revision, the folder **documentation** contains an informal guide and a suggested approach to establish a baseline or foundation for successfully deploying and running Anypoint Flex Gateway on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate. As of this writing, the proposed approach leverages the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) for provisioning and configuring the AWS resources. However, if you have experience provisioning and configuring AWS resources, you could complete all the steps using the AWS management console or leverage an Infrastructure as Code approach (IaC) using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Terraform, etc.
